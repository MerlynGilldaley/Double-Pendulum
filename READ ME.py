PENDULUM SIMULATION:
    
    DOUBLE PENDULUM FOLDER:
        This contains a class for the double pendulum (Pendulum2) and a subclass for the energy of the double pendulum
        From this there are three files that call these classes to run the code:
            1) angleVStime_double:
            Can be used to plot the angle vs time of the double pendulum and also the x/y coordinates of the pendulum
            2) plot_conservation:
            Plots the kinetic, potential and total energy of the double pendulum
            3) change in energy:
            Plots the percentage change in total energy for different time steps between iterations
        
            
        
            
    SINGLE PENDULUM FOLDER:
        This contains a class for the single pendulum (Pendulum1) and a subclass for the energy (conservation_laws)
        From this there are 4 files that call these classes to run the code:
            1) angleVStime 
            plots the angle of the simple pendulum agaisnt time.
            2) conservaton energy 1 
            plots the kinetic, potentail and total energy of the pendulum
            3) small angle approx
            plots the angleVStime plot against the small angle approximation of the pendulum
